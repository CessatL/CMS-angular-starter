CMS angular starter, see [Live demo](http://cms.murhafsousli.com/)

Designed to work with [WordPress API](http://v2.wp-api.org/).


**Introduction:**

This is a client application that is TOTALLY seperated from the server side, for ex: the client app URL is http://example.com

And the server side is the wordpress site where we fetch the data from.. lets say http://backend.example.com or http://anotherexample.com 

but it can't be the same URL as the client app. WHY? because this is not a wordpress theme.


**Features:**

built with the awesome angular2, *current* features:

 - Table for users list.
 - User profile.
 - Add/update/delete Users.
 - 5 different user roles for authorization.
 - Custom secured routes. - you can lock specific page for specific users for instance: *only admin users can view users table*.
 

#UPDATE:


The current demo will connect to the localhost server where I was testing it. you can fork and change the server address to your own.

It is all about WP API, I use **Pods** plugin to extend the API functionality easily and make relations between tables.

I want to note that I'm currently working on other projects, but I will provide more information, updates and improvements to this repo if it gets more attention.

Ask me anything via email murhafsousli@gmail.com, or DM me on twitter (@MurhafSousli)[https://twitter.com/MurhafSousli]

Have a nice day.
